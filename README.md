# Murmure

A privacy-first, open-source speech-to-text application that runs entirely on your machine, powered by a neural network via NVIDIA’s Parakeet model for fast, local transcription. Murmure turns your voice into text with no internet connection and zero data collection, and supports 25 European languages.

## Installation

### Windows (Official)

⚠️ Windows SmartScreen : This installer is **not signed with a commercial certificate** (which costs ~€200–€500/year).  
If you downloaded it from our **official GitHub releases**, you can safely continue.

🛡️ We guarantee the installer is safe, contains **no malware**, and you can verify the source code or even compile it yourself if you prefer.

1. Download murmure_{version}_x64_en-US.msi from the [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

### Linux (Official)

⚠️ Murmure doesn’t work well on Wayland-based distributions (except Fedora, which has no issues). It seems to be a problem related to the Tauri framework I used, and being on X11 doesn’t make it easy for me to fix the issue.

1. Download murmure_{version}_amd64.AppImage from [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x murmure-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Run the AppImage.

Murmure uses the [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) API to
access your microphone, so if you're running Pipewire for your audio stack,
make sure that the ALSA API calls are routed through it (e.g. by installing
[the `pipewire-alsa`
package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pipewire-alsa/) on Arch
Linux), otherwise you'll have errors such as `ALSA lib
pcm_dsnoop.c:567:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave`.

#### Arch Linux (Community)

⚠️ Community builds are maintained by kind contributors on a best-effort basis.
They do their best to keep them up to date, but there’s no guarantee they will always be.
If you encounter a bug with one of these packages, please open an issue in the corresponding community repository instead.

Community repository: https://github.com/Horgix/aur-package_murmure_mirror

On Arch Linux, you can install [the `murmure` package directly from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/murmure) using your favorite helper:

```sh
aura -A murmure
# Or
yay -S murmure
# Or
paru -S murmure
```

## Usage

Murmure provides a clean and focused speech-to-text experience.
Once launched, simply start recording your voice. The text appears instantly, processed directly on your computer.

Typical use cases include:

- Dictating to any AI prompt (Cursor, ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.)
- Writing notes hands-free
- Capturing creative ideas or dictation

Because all computation is local, no network connection is required.

## Technology

Murmure uses NVIDIA’s Parakeet TDT, a highly optimized, experimental transformer-based speech recognition model designed for low-latency, on-device inference. It combines fast transcription with strong accuracy across multiple languages, running efficiently on consumer GPUs or CPUs.
