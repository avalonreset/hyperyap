# Murmure

A privacy-first, open-source speech-to-text application that runs entirely on your machine, powered by a neural network via NVIDIA’s Parakeet model for fast, local transcription. Murmure turns your voice into text with no internet connection and zero data collection, and supports 25 European languages.

- **Powered by Parakeet**: NVIDIA’s state-of-the-art speech recognition model runs entirely on-device for fast, low-latency transcription.

## Supported Languages:

Bulgarian (bg), Croatian (hr), Czech (cs), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English (en), Estonian (et), Finnish (fi), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Maltese (mt), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es), Swedish (sv), Russian (ru), Ukrainian (uk)

## Installation

### Windows

⚠️ Windows SmartScreen : This installer is **not signed with a commercial certificate** (which costs ~€200–€500/year).  
If you downloaded it from our **official GitHub releases**, you can safely continue.

🛡️ We guarantee the installer is safe, contains **no malware**, and you can verify the source code — or even compile it yourself if you prefer.

1. Download murmure_{version}_x64_en-US.msi from the [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

### Linux

⚠️ Murmure doesn’t work well on Wayland-based distributions (except Fedora, which has no issues). It seems to be a problem related to the Tauri framework I used, and being on X11 doesn’t make it easy for me to fix the issue.

1. Download murmure_{version}_amd64.AppImage from [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x murmure-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Run the AppImage.

Murmure uses the [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) API to
access your microphone, so if you're running Pipewire for your audio stack,
make sure that the ALSA API calls are routed through it (e.g. by installing
[the `pipewire-alsa`
package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pipewire-alsa/) on Arch
Linux), otherwise you'll have errors such as `ALSA lib
pcm_dsnoop.c:567:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave`.

## Usage

Murmure provides a clean and focused speech-to-text experience.
Once launched, simply start recording your voice. The text appears instantly, processed directly on your computer.

Typical use cases include:

- Dictating to any AI prompt (Cursor, ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.)
- Writing notes hands-free
- Capturing creative ideas or dictation

Because all computation is local, no network connection is required.

## Technology

Murmure uses NVIDIA’s Parakeet TDT, a highly optimized, experimental transformer-based speech recognition model designed for low-latency, on-device inference. It combines fast transcription with strong accuracy across multiple languages, running efficiently on consumer GPUs or CPUs.
